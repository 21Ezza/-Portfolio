## About me
My name is Eza Nanda. I am a software tester. I found out about this profession relatively recently and I liked it very much, I care even more about development, so I have set my daily routine on the priority of learning as much as I can in the field, including test automation. Being a software tester has been a milestone in my professional career and the position of developer is my professional goal due to the variety of tasks and development opportunities.
